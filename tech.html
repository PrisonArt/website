								People accrue debt while incarcerated. On returning to society, they struggle to find employment. An increasingly privatized system then reincarcerates these human beings for failure to pay their debts. It is <i>exactly</i> this kind of economic double-bind which open and permissionless networks for the creation and distribution of value can solve.

						<p>
							These articles all provide clear and well-researched evidence for how, and how much, debt accrues during incarceration, and the effects this has on the lives of returning citizens.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Pr1s0n Art Project will aim to cover legal financial obligations (LFOs) ahead of other debts as these are least controversial. In 2016, returning citizens averaged ~$10k debt on release. LFOs are roughly 55% of these debts, which averages out to around $5,500 per person.

							"I learned a long time ago that prison does not define us; it is what we do while we are in here that defines us."
						</p>
						<p>
							"I think it’s really important not just to discuss the art, but to discuss the system that this art is coming out of and responding to. We’re supposedly decarcerating — people are being let out—but so many people are getting this very cruel parole. Even though we’re supposedly decarcerating, in a way we’re just expanding carceral structures. There’s also lots of entities benefitting from that. Often, people who are on life parole are wearing some kind of a monitor — they’re actually paying fees. They’re actually paying for this partial freedom."
						</p>
						<p>
							"The thing that artwork does is it allows you to create your own value system. It’s the one thing the prison cannot take away from you. In that space of creativity, you have full autonomy and agency to do whatever you want, however you want to do it, create whatever world you want to create, and that little space can be infinite, and it’s enough to see the multitudes of everything that exists within you."
