								"This artwork isn't out to make an overtly political statement. Like all good art, it organizes elements in the world around it in order to make an audience see and feel in a new way."
							</p>
							<p>
								We believe we can use public, programmable, transparent flows of value in order to cultivate compassion. We don't wish to establish a new world order: if we make a genuine and felt difference in the life of just one person, that will be enough. If we illustrate the kinds of collective economic storytelling practices required to create new systems of restorative justice, then it will be a dream come true.
							</p>
							<h1 class="major">Partner With Us</h1>
							<p>
								Much like happiness, dreams are only real when shared. We're always looking for community partners - people who run existing prison art programs, or who already work with government institutions - who would like to help create more systems of restorative justice.
							</p>
							<p>
								We will assist you in setting up the tools you'll need to particpate in this project, which is really just one thing. You'll need to <strong class="question">create a digital wallet</strong> to which some pre-specified percentage of any proceeds will be programmatically sent once any sale is concluded.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Pr1s0n Art Project itself uses a <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/welcome" target="_blank" class="green-link">Gnosis Safe</a> wallet, which requires multiple signatures to authorise any transaction, just like some bank accounts. If you have no experience with this technology, we recommend you begin by setting up <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" class="green-link">MetaMask</a>, a browser extension which secures your keys and will live in the top right of your screen for whenever you need it.
							</p> 
							<h2 class="major">Our Offer</h2>
							<p>
								Only digital copies are sold through Pr1s0n Art. We will work with you to gather the physical pieces to be sold, digitize them (using high-definition photography), and collect the information we need about each participating artist to ensure transparency and accountability. If you provide what you can of the items listed items in "Our Ask", we promise to promote, encode, sell, and distribute the proceeds based on our customized and agreed upon percentages, tailored to your specific needs and always ensuring that the prisoners receive the majority share in the pursuit of clearing their debt so they may re-enter society with a better chance at living a wholesome life.
							</p>
							<h2 class="major">Our Ask</h2>
							<p>
								In order to achieve this, we will need a few things from you, which we are also willing to help you collate:
							</p>
							<ul class="captain">
								<li>
									An inmate release form authorizing you to digitize inmate art and sell the digital copy. It should detail:
								</li>
									<ul class="sub-cap">
										<li>
											Name
										</li>
										<li>
											Inmate ID
										</li>
										<li>
											Prisoner Jurisdiction
										</li>
										<li>
											Specific electronic payment addresses for each artist: for restitution fees, court fees, etc.
										</li>
										<li>
											The manner in which the proceeds are to be split, e.g. 70% debts/fees, 20% Community Partner, 10% PR1S0N ART Treasury.
										</li>
									</ul>
								<li>
									Authorization of the incarcerating jurisdiction.
								</li>
								<li>
									Curated biographical/auto-biographical write-ups, video, essays, poetry regarding artists and pieces that create provenance and help promote the work.
								</li>
								<li>
									It would also be to all our benefit if you were will to participate in the promotion of the artworks/artists.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h2 class="major">Common Questions</h2>
							<p>
								<strong class="question">How can we be sure that the percentage of sales will be split according to our agreement?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Each new art project is created by virtue of a "smart contract": some public code on Ethereum that anyone in the world can see and verify for themselves. When creating a new art project, this contract enforces that the percentage splits for any sale are specified. Once this is done, there is no way to change it and whatever money is made from the sale is automatically split by the same contract. This is what we mean when we say we can use public, programmable, transparent flows of value in order to cultivate compassion. Our intention is clear, verifiable and irreversible from the moment any art project is created.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong class="question">What happens to any extra proceeds?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Often jurisdictions place a limit on how much prisoners can receive from any activity while incarcerated. Or, it may be the case that a project sells for more money than the debt owed by the prisoners involved. What happens in this case? We simply  leave the extra money in our public, on-chain Treasury account, which is controlled by a <a href="https://github.com/PrisonArt/transparency/blob/main/PR1S0NART_bylaws_final.pdf" target="_blank" class="green-link">registered 501(c)(3) company in Florida</a>. It can then be used to pay down debt in other projects, or for various other possible prisoner needs as and when they arise. The important thing is that, as a Non-Profit Company, we literally cannot profit from this: we are here to serve the needs of those for whom justice has yet to balance the books.
