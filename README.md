# The Prison Art Project

People accrue debt while incarcerated. On returning to society, they struggle to find employment. An increasingly privatized system then reincarcerates these human beings for failure to pay their debts. It is _exactly_ this kind of economic double-bind which open and permissionless networks for the creation and distribution of value can solve.

## Basic Idea

1. Work with existing art programs.
2. Digitise the art, bundle it into one collection at a time and make it into a NFT.
3. Sell the NFT. 
    - 70% goes to an NPO to pay prisoner debt
    - 20% goes to the Community Partner running the existing program
    - 10% into a yield-bearing on-chain endowment fund to make it sustainable
4. Rinse and repeat.

## Is This A DAO?

The DAO that can be named is not the eternal DAO.

Open, verifiable, executable contracts on ownerless networks allow us to organise institutions which are more like shared practices and customs than complex bureaucracies. We offer here a description of a **shared practice** for systems of restorative justice.
