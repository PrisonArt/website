								We collect, digitize, and sell artwork made in prisons. Smart contracts ensure the proceeds can only pay very specific debts and fines, like restitution and court fees. We do this in a verifiable and transparent way so there is no question of the project’s activities.

							<h2>What Problems We Solve</h2>
							<p>
								Justice involved people incur financial obligations as a result of their history and incarceration, like restitution payments for victims, court fees, and driver's license reinstatement fees. Upon release, 88% of states re-incarcerate people for failure to pay back these debts, accounting for roughly 30% of recidivism in the US.
							</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>In Prison</h3>
									<p>
										Low staff to incarcerated ratios mean less programs and more idle time. This leads to increased violence and illicit activity and decreased safety for everyone.
										Staffing challenges are increasing along with populations, which is further exacerbated by decreasing budgets. We must find a way of funding programs sustainably.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-unlock"></span>
									<h3>Release and Re-entry</h3>
									<p>
										Returning citizens are unprepared. They have no skills, no job and looming financial debts incurred as a result of conviction. Their inability to pay obligatory debt leads to new crime or reincarceration and the majority of states rearrest simply for failure to pay.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Economics</h3>
									<p>
										Nationally, there are billions of dollars in uncollected debt. With decreasing revenue and increasing costs - be it policing, victimization, courts and legal fees, overcrowded  jails and prisons, devolving communities and families, or generational criminals - the only solution to cover expenses is to increase the tax base.
									</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-gem"></span>
									<h3>Society & Health</h3>
									<p>
										There are pressing concerns like mental health and addiction which we don't have time to address given the burden of debt faced by most. Prisons are left to deal with these challenges, yet they are not established to be rehab, behavioral therapy, or mental health facilities.

				<!-- The Solution -->
					<section id="the-solution" class="wrapper style2 fade-up">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2 class="txt-white">Our Solution</h2>
							<p class="txt-white">
								The PR1S0N Art project teams up with existing art programs and community prison partners to create digital <strong>collections</strong>. Each collection is sold as an <a href="tech.html" class="green-link">NFT on Ethereum</a>. The funds raised from the sale are used to pay prisoner’s financial debts, reducing re-entry friction, re-incarceration rates, restoring dignity to the returning citizens and enabling government institutions to retrieve billions of dollars in uncollected debts. 
							</p>
							<p class="txt-white">
								Receipts from debt payments are added back to the collection, so a collector holds not just art, but the full transactional story of a human being's restorative journey. The collection includes artworks from multiple artists, but is sold as a single object, which creates a provably equitable way of splitting funds among artists.
							</p>
							<h2 class="txt-white">Totally Transparent</h2>
							<p class="txt-white">
								The information associated with each collection is stored permanently on Ethereum and can be verified by anyone. This includes name, inmate ID, and jurisdiction, along with the digital artworks. The proceeds of any sale are handled by a smart contract, the <a href="https://github.com/PrisonArt/restore" target="_blank" class="green-link">source code</a> for which anyone can also verify. This contract enforces the correct distribution of funds and cannot be intefered with.
							</p>
							<p class="txt-white">
								The debt payments are handled by PR1S0N ART INC. a Florida 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Organization. The receipts from these payments are are added to the information associated with the collection on Ethereum, so anyone can reconcile the sale amount with the total debt paid for each artist and ensure that everything balances.
