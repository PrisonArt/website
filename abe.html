                                        Abe isn't the sort of man to talk much about himself. So we went ahead and put together this for him as a gift and a remembrance of just some of the good he has done with his time in this world. When he eventually handed over some revealing details, he stressed that "although I feel it identifies many things accomplished during my civic prison duty, the accolades belong to an amazing team of people who assembled under a united cause and executed beautifully on the vision."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He is that most rare of creatures: a good man. We are privileged to know and work with him.
